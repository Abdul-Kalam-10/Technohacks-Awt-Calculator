AWT Description
AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) is a set of classes in Java that provides the foundation for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
It is one of the core libraries in Java for creating desktop applications with a GUI.
AWT was the original GUI toolkit for Java and has been part of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) since its early versions.
Although Swing (also part of Java SE) provides a more advanced and flexible GUI framework, AWT is still used in some cases and serves as the underlying framework for Swing.
